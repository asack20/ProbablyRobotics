# Reinforcement Learning in Pursuit Evasion Game
Tufts Probabilistic Robotics Spring 2020 Final Project

# PursuitEvasionGame
The goal of our project

# TO DO
* make sure that the observation mechanism works
* save policies to File 
* change reward function
* only draw every x number of simulations for speed
* make a better map
* make a script that runs both robots on the optimal policy (easy)


# Dependencies
python version >= 3.6
pip
numpy
gym
matplotlib


# How to run an example
python runsim.py


# File Descriptions
* runsim.py: Runs the whole simulation and the iterations of the Q-Learning
  algorithm

* map.py:
  implements and contains the entire robotic environment encompassing the Map
  and both robots

* robot.py:

* pursuer.py:

* evader.py:

* install_dependencies.sh:
